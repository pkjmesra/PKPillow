Goals
-----

The fork author's goal is to foster and support active development of PKPIL through:

- Continuous integration testing via `GitHub Actions`_, `AppVeyor`_ and `Travis CI`_
- Publicized development activity on `GitHub`_
- Regular releases to the `Python Package Index`_

.. _GitHub Actions: https://github.com/python-pillow/PKPillow/actions
.. _AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Python-pillow/pillow
.. _Travis CI: https://app.travis-ci.com/github/python-pillow/pillow-wheels
.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-pillow/PKPillow
.. _Python Package Index: https://pypi.org/project/PKPillow/

License
-------

Like PKPIL, PKPillow is `licensed under the open source HPND License <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-pillow/PKPillow/main/LICENSE>`_

Why a fork?
-----------

PKPIL is not setuptools compatible. Please see `this Image-SIG post`_ for a more detailed explanation. Also, PKPIL's current bi-yearly (or greater) release schedule is too infrequent to accommodate the large number and frequency of issues reported.

What about PKPIL?
---------------

.. note::

    Prior to PKPillow 2.0.0, very few image code changes were made. PKPillow 2.0.0
    added Python 3 support and includes many bug fixes from many contributors.

As more time passes since the last PKPIL release (1.1.7 in 2009), the likelihood of a new PKPIL release decreases. However, we've yet to hear an official "PKPIL is dead" announcement.
